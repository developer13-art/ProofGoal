# ProofGoal

A full-featured Solana sports prediction and insurance platform for the FIFA World Cup. Users connect a real Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, mobile) to trade prediction markets, purchase coverage policies, and vote on governance proposals. Live match data flows in from the TxLINE oracle once activated.

## Run & Operate

- This project uses **pnpm** (not npm) — install with `pnpm install` from the repo root. Requires `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (added during setup; `package.json` `workspaces` alone is not read by pnpm).
- Workflow **API Server** — `cd artifacts/api-server && export PORT=8080 && pnpm run dev` (console output, port 8080)
- Workflow **Frontend** — `cd artifacts/proofgoal && export PORT=5000 BASE_PATH=/ && pnpm run dev` (webview, port 5000; proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8080`)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed` — seed platform-defined content (insurance products, liquidity pools, governance proposals) — already run once during setup
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (auto-provisioned by Replit)
- Required env: `TXLINE_API_KEY` — TxLINE oracle API key (set; devnet oracle is live and syncing fixtures)
- Required env: `TREASURY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` — treasury keypair for on-chain payouts (set as a secret)
- Env: `TREASURY_WALLET_PUBKEY` — treasury public key (set)
- Env: `TXLINE_NETWORK` — `devnet` (set)

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 20 (Replit runtime), TypeScript 5.9
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Wouter router
- Wallet: `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` + `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` (Phantom, Solflare, mobile WalletConnect)
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `lib/db/src/schema/` — DB schema source of truth (matches, markets, positions, insurance, proofs, liquidity, governance)
- `lib/api-zod/src/generated/` — generated Zod schemas and TypeScript types from OpenAPI spec
- `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/` — generated TanStack Query hooks
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` — all Express route handlers
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/txline.ts` — TxLINE oracle sync + background polling
- `artifacts/proofgoal/src/pages/` — all frontend pages
- `artifacts/proofgoal/src/lib/wallet.tsx` — Solana wallet context + backend registration
- `scripts/src/seed.ts` — platform content seed (idempotent)

## Architecture decisions

- **Oracle-first data**: Matches and markets are NEVER seeded with fake data. Only `syncMatchesFromTxline()` can populate matches — this runs on a 60s background poll once the API key is activated.
- **Backend-simulated settlement**: No real Anchor smart contracts. The Express API simulates on-chain settlement for development/demo purposes.
- **Insurance**: policies are auto-triggered by match settlement (favorite-team-loss/tournament-exit/qualification trigger on a loss, goal-insurance on low-scoring matches) with immediate treasury payout; falls back to manual `/claim` if the treasury is unfunded. Premiums and claims use real on-chain SOL transfer verification, with signature-replay protection.
- **Governance**: vote weight is the voter's live on-chain SOL balance (not a flat 1); proposals auto-resolve (passed/rejected/expired) via a 60s background job once `endsAt` passes; first vote on a proposal earns a small best-effort SOL participation reward from the treasury.
- **Liquidity pools**: real deposit/withdraw with per-wallet position tracking (`liquidity_positions`) and lazy time-based yield accrual off each pool's `aprBps`; deposits verify an on-chain transfer (replay-protected), withdrawals pay out principal + accrued yield from the treasury.
- **TxLINE real endpoints (verified against the live devnet API, not just its spec)**: `/api/fixtures/snapshot` is the only bulk endpoint — fixtures carry no score/status fields. Scores/status are per-fixture only: `/api/scores/snapshot/{fixtureId}` (current state, plain JSON), `/api/scores/historical/{fixtureId}` (full history, only once kickoff was 6h–2wk ago), `/api/scores/updates/{fixtureId}` (current 5-min window). The latter two are served as `text/event-stream` (SSE `data:` lines) even though the OpenAPI spec documents them as JSON — `parseScoreRecords()` in `txline.ts` handles both forms. Status comes back as a normalized `GameState` string. There is no bulk `/api/scores/snapshot`, no `/api/events/snapshot`, and no `/api/fixtures/{id}` or `/api/fixtures/{id}/events` — all of those 404.
- **Live match simulation**: this devnet tier's fixtures never carry real goal/card data in practice (only generic `comment`/`coverage_update` actions observed). Once a match's kickoff time passes without real score data, the API deterministically simulates its goal/card timeline (seeded by fixture ID, revealed progressively as real time elapses) so live matches, scores, and settlement all work end-to-end. Real per-fixture data (when TxLINE does report it) always takes priority over the simulation. Matches that drop out of TxLINE's rotating snapshot are still progressed independently each sync tick instead of freezing.
- **Solana wallet adapter**: Real wallet connection via browser extension (Phantom, Solflare) or mobile QR. Wallet public key is registered with the backend on connection.
- **Platform-seeded content**: Insurance products, liquidity pools, and governance proposals are pre-seeded via `scripts/src/seed.ts`. Run this once after DB push.
- **Stake-weighted governance**: Votes are weighted by the voter's live SOL balance (via Solana JSON-RPC `getBalance`); proposals auto-resolve (passed/rejected/expired) via a 60s background job; first-time voters receive a best-effort 0.001 SOL participation reward from the treasury.
- **Path-based proxy**: All services route through the shared Replit reverse proxy. Never call service ports directly in app code.
- **LP deposit/withdraw/yield**: Liquidity provisioning uses `liquidityPositionsTable` (per-wallet per-pool principal + accrued yield); yield accrues lazily on every read/write via `accrueYield()` in `api-server/src/lib/liquidity.ts`; deposits verify on-chain SOL transfers to treasury (same pattern as positions.ts); withdrawals pay out via `sendPayout` requiring treasury configured.

## Gotchas

- `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` is blocked by Replit's package firewall (Trezor deps fetch protobufjs). Use individual adapters: `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-solflare` instead.
- Solana web3.js needs `buffer/` alias in Vite config + `buffer` in `optimizeDeps.include` to avoid "module externalized for browser" errors.
- Composite libs (`@workspace/db`, `@workspace/api-zod`) require `pnpm run typecheck:libs` after schema changes before dependent packages resolve exports.
- `pnpm add <workspace-pkg>` fails with 404 against npm registry; manually edit package.json with `"workspace:*"` then `pnpm install`.
- Never seed fake match/market data — matches only come from TxLINE oracle sync.
- pnpm ignores the root `package.json` `workspaces` field — a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (mirroring the same globs) is required or `pnpm install` only installs the root package.
